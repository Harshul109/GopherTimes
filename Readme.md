This is the source code for GopherTimes.com - a community website for the Go programming language.

Go is probably someone's trademark - maybe even Google's.  

This code isn't exactly beautiful yet, I'm focusing on large swaths of functionality before refactoring into attractive code to be proud of.  Patches and pull requests always welcome.
